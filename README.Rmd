# Advanced R

### Course Description

Welcome to Advanced R\! This short course builds onto the [Intro to R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intro-R) 
and [Intermediate R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intermediate-R) courses and provides 
a hands-on approach to moving from journeyman to master with the R programming
language. In this course you will gain deeper knowledge around writing good
functions, applying functional programming, working with R's various classes,
tidy eval, measuring and improving code performance, and writing R packages. The
following is an outline of the material covered in this training:

___Schedule is still being refined and is subject to change; however, the topics should remain the same.___

### Course Preparation

To prepare for this course please complete the following ***prior*** to
the day of class:

1.  Download the class material at [TBD]().
    This will provide you with the data and R scripts to follow along
    during class. I have also included handy cheat sheets that you can
    reference throughout different sections.

2.  All slides are available via the hyperlinks in the schedule above so
    that you can follow along.

3.  Please have the following versions of R and RStudio installed. If
    you have an earlier version of R that is at least version 3.4.5 or
    later you should be ok but its best to be as current as possible.
    
      - R: 3.5.1 \[[download latest
        version](https://cran.r-project.org/)\]
      - RStudio: 1.1.463 \[[download latest
        version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\]
        
4. This course makes ___strong___ assumptions about your prior knowledge. To ensure your
   success, be sure that you have reviewed and are comfortable with the material
   covered in the [Intro to R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intro-R) and [Intermediate R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intermediate-R) 
   courses.
